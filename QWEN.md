# GitHub Page Repository Context

## Project Overview
This is a GitHub Pages repository for `x-multibyte.github.io` that hosts a personal portfolio website. The site is built as a single HTML file (`index.html`) containing embedded CSS and JavaScript, featuring a modern, responsive design with dark/light mode support.

The portfolio template is titled "John Doe - Portfolio" and includes sections for:
- Hero section with personal introduction
- About section with skills
- Projects showcase 
- Contact form
- Responsive navigation and footer

## Repository Purpose
This repository serves as a GitHub Pages site for the user `x-multibyte`, providing a public-facing portfolio website. GitHub Pages automatically serves the content from the main branch, making it accessible at https://x-multibyte.github.io.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Main portfolio page with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- `.qwen/settings.json`: Qwen Code configuration settings
- `.git/config`: Git configuration with remote origin pointing to GitHub
- `QWEN.md`: This context file

## Technical Details
The portfolio website features:
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Dark/light mode toggle functionality with system preference detection
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Form submission handling with JavaScript
- Modern CSS using CSS variables, Flexbox, and Grid
- Embedded Font Awesome icons via CDN
- Placeholder images for demonstration purposes

## GitHub Integration
The repository was created using the GitHub CLI (`gh repo create`) and configured with Git commands to set up the remote origin. It's ready to be deployed as a GitHub Pages site.

## Development Context
This is a frontend-focused project using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The template provides a foundation that can be customized with real content, project details, and contact information. No build tools or frameworks are used, making it simple to maintain and deploy directly to GitHub Pages.

## Building and Running
The site is designed to run directly in a browser without any build steps. Simply open `index.html` in a browser, or deploy to GitHub Pages by pushing to the main branch.

## Deployment
Deployed automatically via GitHub Pages when content is pushed to the main branch. The current repository is configured to serve content from the main branch at the root path.
